# ESP32-S3 Sense — Wake Word & Face Recognition (Under Development)

This repository contains an **edge AI project** built on **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense**, focusing on **wake word detection** and **face recognition** running directly on-device.

The project explores **low-power, real-time AI inference** on microcontrollers using **TinyML** and **embedded computer vision**, with the goal of building an always-on, privacy-preserving smart edge system.

> 🚧 Status: **Under Development**  
> Features, architecture, and performance are subject to change.
